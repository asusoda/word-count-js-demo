# JavaScript Demo: A Word Counter

*The JavaScript basics demo of a web page that counts words.*

This demonstration was made for the Intro to JavaScript talk at [SoDA](https://thesoda.io).

Take a look at the [talk slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mtxxSpUGrd831Afmzd9HedntjkSSUA7yiPHD5OsBIIs/edit?usp=sharing) and [talk recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vwm8Ma29QHU72rTAUqRtIDflFyovAGbM/view?usp=sharing).

This git repository contains a web page ([`index.html`](index.html)) which loads a JavaScript file ([`demo.js`](demo.js)) using a `<script>` element. In `demo.js`, we count how many words a person has typed into a text area as they type, and display the word count below the text area. The word count turns green when they have met their goal, which they write in a text box, for the number of words.

In this code, we use functions, if statements, strings, numbers, `const` and `let` declarations, and the DOM (Document Object Model).

Check [`demo.js`](demo.js) for the code and a walkthrough of how it works.
